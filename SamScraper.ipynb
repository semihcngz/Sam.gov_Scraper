            "('2025 Request for White Papers: NASA SBIR Phase II Sequential Awards', '2025 Request for White Papers: NASA SBIR Phase II Sequential AwardsBackgroundNASA is considering inviting companies to propose for Sequential Phase II awards with higher award values ranging between $2.5 Million to $4 Million through the Agency’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program in 2025. These awards would facilitate rapid post Phase II development of technologies with the goal to infuse key technologies that reach specific milestones into specific NASA programs..2. PurposeWhy is NASA requesting this information? The SBIR program is performing a portfolio evaluation exercise with the aim of determining what NASA SBIR Phase II technologies show the promise of risk reduction for key programs, and what firms are capable candidates for further investment through a potential Sequential Phase II award. NASA has a large SBIR Phase II portfolio to evaluate, and this exercise will help accomplish two objectives: 1. Highlight and map SBIR Phase II technologies to key programs with white papers providing additional context and details about opportunities for small business technology development. 2. Provide a participatory method for interested parties to communicate that they are engaged and ready to support a subset of NASA’s priorities that may be appropriate for small business participation, as described in this call for white papers.3. DisclaimerNASA reserves the right to use the information received from these white papers in any way it chooses, including determinations to invite companies to propose for a Phase II Sequential award. A Phase II Awardee may receive one additional, Sequential Phase II award to continue the work of an initial Phase II award without additional competition. Responding to this call for white papers is not a prerequisite to participating in any post Phase II program. This white paper can be used for programmatic planning to assess the state of small business capability and does not constitute a funding opportunity or a formal competition. Respondents should be advised that NASA takes no financial responsibility for any expenses incurred for responding to the white paper call.Respondents should not expect to receive feedback or response to their submission. Future awards (if any) will be subject to and contingent upon the availability of funds. If proposal invitations do occur, NASA notionally anticipates reaching out to firms around January 2025.4; Timeline and Method for ResponsesNASA uses electronically supported business processes for the SBIR/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. An offeror must have internet access and an email address. Paper submissions are not accepted.The Electronic Handbook (EHB) for submitting white papers is located at http://sbir.nasa.gov under the Handbooks section; please refer to the SBIR/STTR Proposal Submission EHB link therein for the portal to submit a white paper. The EHB guides firms through the steps for submitting a white paper. All EHB submissions are through a secure connection. Communication between NASA’s SBIR/STTR programs and the firm is primarily through a combination of EHB and email.The submissions site will be available from August 13, 2024 to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to September 23, 2024.A complete white paper package shall be received no later than 5:00 p.m. ET on September 23, 2024 via the NASA SBIR/STTR website (http://sbir.nasa.gov), under the Handbooks section. The EHB will no longer accept submissions after this deadline as reflected by the internal EHB clock. Submission after the deadline will result in the offeror receiving an access denied message from the EHB; this reflects that the deadline has been exceeded. Any remaining parts of the white paper package will not be uploaded or able to be completed. If a complete white paper package, containing all requested content per section 8 of this Request for White Papers, is not received by the 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time deadline, the white paper package will be determined to be incomplete and will not be assessed. Neither the NASA SBIR/STTR Technical Support Help Desk nor the NASA SBIR/STTR Program Management Office will be able to accept white paper packages after the 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 23, 2024 deadline has been exceeded.5. EligibilityFirms are eligible to submit a white paper if they have a prior NASA SBIR Phase II award from Program Years 2013 to present as long as the prior Phase II contract has not already received a Sequential Phase II award, from any government agency including NASA.Technical Need Areas (TNAs) indicate subtopics which the SBIR program has assessed as having content that may be applicable to these TNAs. However, firms with prior SBIR Phase IIs from NASA Program Years 2013 to present who have not yet received a Sequential Phase II award on that prior Phase II from any agency may submit a white paper in response to a TNA so long as they justify in the white paper how the continued development of their prior Phase II innovation meets stated goals within the Technical Need Area.Prior Phase II awards must also be completed, including any option periods, by August 1, 2025. Completed awards are awards where contract period of performance has expired, and all deliverables have been accepted by the Government. The prior Phase II contract also must not have already received a Sequential Phase II award, from any government agency including NASA.Firms must justify in the white paper how the continued development of their prior Phase II innovation meets stated goals within the TNA. Development efforts should largely continue from the end status and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) development status of the prior Phase II development and/or any continued efforts that happened since the end of the Phase II effort. The detailed effort should involve and justify the continued development of at least one of the primary technologies already developed during the prior applicable Phase II. While some re-development may be required for the specific application purposes called out in these Technical Need Areas, any significant new developments that differ from the prior Phase II technology or re-developments that impact the technology should be justified as pertinent to the original Phase II award and the TNA the white paper is being submitted under. Likewise, impacts to the starting TRL should be justified. White papers on technologies that are not adequately justified as relevant continuations of the prior cited Phase II or are not compliant may not be assessed or considered.Additionally, only firms who continue to qualify as Small Business Concerns (SBCs), as defined here: http://sbir.nasa.gov/content/nasa-sbirsttr-program-definitions, are eligible to submit white papers.White paper submissions are limited to a maximum of 2 (two) responses per TNA.These Technical Need Areas may have multiple vested programs and/or use cases. Within that TNA, white papers may justify the technology as applicable to as few or as many of those applicable programs or cases as is appropriate; however, each white paper may only pertain to one TNA.These TNAs have been identified for this announcement due to their near-term NASA relevance. Topics/subtopics within the TNA were identified based on the technical applicability of the original solicitation subtopic to current needs, pertinence and timeliness to priority objectives and needs, evaluations against the current state of the art and available technologies, and cross program relevance. Note that the lack of inclusion of a given subtopic/program year and the technologies developed from that cycle does not reflect a NASA position on those technologies.Note that while some topics/subtopics in given program years are identified for a TNA, the original scope of those topics/subtopics, and original awards therein, may have been more expansive than the current stated need. While a given prior award may be included within that topic/subtopic and program year, please review the need statement for that TNA to decide if you think that your technology is pertinent to this current development opportunity. White papers on technologies that are not applicable, or whose development path diverges from the stated need, will not be considered.Developments must be directly related to and continue the prior Phase II work and must demonstrate relevance to both the applicable original solicitation subtopic and current cited NASA goals in this area. Note that any further development beyond the prior Phase II conducted (through various NASA SBIR program funding vehicles, other NASA mechanisms, or other development avenues), that may be completed or ongoing, should be discussed in establishing the current state of the technology leading into a potential future development effort. If there is ongoing work on the technology, detail the work, the anticipated completion timeframe, and any known risks/implications to a follow-on development resulting from the ongoing work.6. Technical Need Areas6.1 Technical Need Area 2025-1: Entry, Descent and Landing Flight Instrumentation Technologies for Precision Landing, Environment Characterization, and System PerformanceNASA human exploration and robotic science missions to the surface of planets and moons require capabilities for executing a successful Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL).  Improved navigation sensors and terrain mapping sensors onboard EDL vehicles lead to increased situational awareness for onboard guidance systems to execute maneuvers to reduce landing dispersions and enable safer and softer touchdowns in terrain regions of scientific or exploration interest.  Flight instrumentation also plays a critical role in EDL system design, implementation, and performance.  Improved entry-environment characterization and entry-system performance have a direct impact on the system designs and validation efforts that can lead to future increases in payload mass-fraction and the reduction of landing dispersions.  This solicitation broadly targets advancements in onboard navigation sensors and flight instrumentation, including reductions in Size, Weight and Power, plus Cost (SWaP-C), and rad-hardend deep space qualification that can support near-term human or robotic missions to the Moon or robotic missions or technology demonstrations relevant for other solar system destinations.  The commercialization thrusts of NASA programs including the Human Lander System (HLS) and Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) provide several opportunities for commercial sensors and instrumentation to be infused into upcoming lunar missions, so this solicitation also favors development of commercial sensors/instruments that have near-term infusion prospects into these commercial opportunities.Proposals must convey knowledge of the state-of-the-art capabilities and provide clear evidence of the comparative advantages (design parameters, performance targets, reductions in integration complexity, SWaP-C reductions, etc.) of the proposed technology over currently available sensors for navigation or environment/performance characterization in relevant EDL mission scenarios.  Proposals must also show a credible path to timely development or evolution of a commercial sensor/instrument for infusion into commercial or NASA missions or technology demonstrations, as well as provide evidence that the proposed capability will be fully qualified for the applicable EDL spaceflight environment (radiation, thermal, vacuum, vibration, etc.).Examples of desired flight sensors for EDL navigation and safe, soft landing include velocity or range sensors (lidar or radar), as well as terrain mapping sensors.  Examples of desired flight instrumentation for environment characterization include sensors (wired or wireless) for temperature, pressure, etc., as well as sensors for entry-system performance characterization (or pre-flight quality assessment) such as TPS temperature, recession, ultrasonic, and other relevant sensors that provide measurement profiles across the thickness of the material.  Another compelling entry instrumentation-system technology is fiber-optic-based systems that could result in lower overall cost and weight to a flight instrumentation system while simultaneously increasing the number of sensors (therefore also increasing the number of measurements).Past Applicable SBIR Subtopics:2014 – H7.01, H13.01, S1.01, S4.012015 – H7.01, H7.02, S1.01, S4.012016 -- H7.01, H7.02, S1.01, S4.012017 -- S1.01, S4.01, Z7.012018 -  S1.01, Z7.012019 -- S1.01, Z7.012020 --  S1.01, Z7.01, Z7.04, Z7.062021 –  A1.09, S1.01, Z7.01, Z7.04, Z7.062022 -- S11.01, Z7.01, Z7.042023 -- S11.01, Z7.01, Z7.04References:A.

The future Mars Transportation System architectures include options for all chemical propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, and nuclear electric propulsion variants.  Applicable relevant scale chemical propulsion options are either relatively mature or receiving significant investments through the Human Landing System program, Exploration Upper Stage development, other government agency projects, and/or private equity.  Nuclear thermal propulsion system demonstration is planned through the DARPA DRACO partnership with an objective for a flight demonstration within three years.  Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) has to date received the fewest NASA investments and maturation is warranted for an informed down selection if / when appropriate.The Mars Architecture Team and a range of studies highlight the performance advantages of Nuclear Electric Propulsion.  At the same time, the National Academies notes the low maturity of potential solutions.  In particular, the cost risk and schedule risk to quickly mature a Nuclear Electric Propulsion system is currently very high due to the large number of known-unknowns and expectations for several remaining unknown-unknown. The Nuclear Electric Propulsion technology challenges include five Critical Technology Elements (CTEs) and related technology development gaps:CTE 1: Reactor and Coolant Subsystem (RXS)CTE 2: Power Conversion Subsystem (PCS)CTE 3: Power Management & Distribution (PMAD) SubsystemCTE 4: Electric Propulsion Subsystem (EPS)CTE 5: Primary Heat Rejection Subsystem (PHRS)White papers are solicited that address any of the Critical Technology Elements as long as specifically relevant to the Nuclear Electric Propulsion application.  The white papers should discuss the current development of the technology.  White papers should discuss the feasibility of using the proposed technology for the end-use Mars Transportation Application, but also discuss interim operational demonstrations or applications with payoff prior to the crewed Mars campaign.  White papers should discuss component, subsystem, and/or system integration and interface features, requirements, and challenges. White papers must define targeted key performance parameters of the proposed system(s).White papers should emphasize Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and subsystem interface definition advancement. The white papers should include a thorough risk assessment, identification of known-unknowns, and activities appropriate to identify unknown-unknowns.  White papers should also note any interface and broader system level advantages to consider during vehicle level trades (e.g., novel PMAD architectures for system level mass benefits and/or applicability with solar power generation).White papers should not emphasize innovation or technology maturation outside of the 5 CTEs. However, system analysis at the vehicle level is encouraged. Design, build, and test of scaled flight hardware or functioning lab models to validate proposed innovations is of high interest.The technologies and systems developed in this effort should retire risk or reduce cost-to-go for near-term flight validation opportunities, subscale integrated system demonstration and/or full-scale operational systems.Technologies and systems developed would address technical gaps identified and defined in the Strategic Framework on NASA’s TechPort, https://techport.nasa.gov/strategy, including:Space Nuclear Electric Propulsion Priority Needs:Subscale Radiator TVAC Tests with heat transfer loopPrototype Electric Propulsion Thruster MaturationEfficient flight-like RF SubsystemHigh Temperature Superconducting MagnetsHigh fidelity structural design to meet anticipated environmentsHigh fidelity thermal design and validationPower Processing Unit (PPU) IEEE Parts Assessment, fabrication, and testing in vacuum.Past Applicable SBIR Subtopics:2014 -- H2.01, H8.02, Z1.032015 -- H2.03, H8.012016 -- H2.032018 -- Z10.022019 -- Z10.022020 -- Z10.042021 -- Z1.06, Z1.07, Z10.03, Z10.042022 -- Z1.06, Z2.01, Z10.03, Z10.042023 -- Z1.06, Z2.01, Z10.03, Z10.04References:“Space Nuclear Propulsion for Human Mars Exploration,” National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2021Martin, A., Polzin, K.

These technologies and their components may support a variety of missions cases with wide ranges in power level, transfer distance, and lifetime.Energy storage is a primary driver in the design of most science and exploration missions. These systems range from small scale rovers and landers to ISRU and habitat systems. Applicable technologies such as batteries and regenerative fuel cells should be lightweight, long-lived, and low cost.Technologies that meet this need have characteristics including: Energy storage materials and components that have been designed to operate in, and survive, the lunar surface environment.Energy storage systems designed for operations at low temperatures. Improvements in performance, reliability, and specific energy might result from advanced chemistries, novel packaging, and/or improved thermal management.Power management systems provide monitoring, control, and regulation to ensure sufficient power is available at all stages reliably throughout a mission. State of the art electronics are needed to provide sufficient durability to support long duration operations in the Lunar thermal, dust, and radiation environments and are needed to be maintainable in those environments. Intelligent and autonomous electrical power systems may also provide benefits for long duration missions where communication and maintenance opportunities are limited. Power management systems capable of troubleshooting and fault correcting would be beneficial.Advances in electrical power technologies are required for the electrical components and systems of these future spacecrafts/platforms to address program size, mass, efficiency, capacity, durability, and reliability requirements. Technologies that meet this need have characteristics including: Robust and reliable power conversion and controller technology.High power density/high efficiency power electronics and associated drivers for switching elements.Non-traditional approaches to switching devices.Lightweight, highly conductive power cables and/or cables integrated with vehicle structures.Intelligent power management and fault-tolerant electrical components and PMAD systems.Past Applicable SBIR Subtopics:2014 -- S3.03, Z1.022015 -- S3.032016 – H8.04, S3.03, Z1.012017 -- S3.03, Z1.022018 – S3.032019 – S3.03, Z1.042020 - Z1.05, Z1.06, S3.032021 - Z1.05, Z1.06, S3.032022 - S13.07, Z1.05, Z1.06,2023 - S13.07, S16.02, Z1.05References:Power and Energy Storage Systems Strategic Framework: https://techport.nasa.gov/file/143282Space Technology Mission Directorate Shortfall 1595 and 1591: https://techport.nasa.gov/file/314645Energy Storage Technologies for Future Planetary Science Missions, December 2017: JPL D-1011467.

The draft solicitation will be posted shortly.', 'TRACTORTEAM@darpa.mil', '[\"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/ce67ef1b609a4b20833280c0b9b9f8d5/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/6bb23d7b07f6488dae9ccaaadd0f3e07/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/9711901417a347e3a7e957afa2483eec/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/b677d502ec82499c9ab406c028213d58/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/fb2fbef0cabb452eac4cb937d84ce169/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/70c7f33ffde94e7bae5e8635af201280/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/2a31f34a2a844cb6b464f84b11c6d915/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/418ed119d93549f7b35e8681aaa9e956/download?&token=\", \"https://sam.gov/api/prod/opps/v3/opportunities/resources/files/b78484ac24e441728cdb50f48f3d544d/download?&token=\"]')\n"
